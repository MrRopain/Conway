Conway
======

My simple C# implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

I do not recommend running this without edits to the code due to the following reasons:
* Runs in fullscreen mode by default
* Visited cells will slowly fade out, which might cause unwanted lag

*This was intended a "weekend" project and it likely won't become much more than that.*
